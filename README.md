# This repository is a fork to experiment with the K230 and Linux on the big core

[Original repository by RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont](https://code.videolan.org/Courmisch/k230-boot)

# Kendryte K230-CanMV Linux boot

This repository provides *all* needed sources to boot the K230-CanMV board
to Linux user-space.

[TOC]

# Motivation

The official [Kendryte K230 SDK](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk)
aims to run a real-time operating system on the "big" C908 found
in the CanMV-K230, with a small Linux system on the "little" core.

This repository on the other hand strives to provide an easier and leaner way
to install a normal Linux distribution (such as Debian, Fedora or Gentoo).
It boots a Linux kernel with support for the RISC-V Vector extension
on the *big* core and with all the RAM.

This repository also dispenses with building the RTOS
and the Busybox build root. The intent is to let *you* install *your* favorite
Linux RISC-V distribution on the root filesystem, while this repository only
builds and makes a tiny flashable image with:
* The two stages of boot loader: U-boot SPL and U-boot,
* OpenSBI, and
* the Linux kernel.

# Differences from vendor SDK

The main differences are:
* At run time:
  * Running Linux on the "big" core.
  * Support for the RISC-V Vector extension for Linux user-space.
  * Full system 512 MiB of RAM available.
  * Only 4 MiB of storage reserved for boot loader.
  * Kernel image in /boot with U-boot syslinux-style distro boot support.
  * Backported bug fixes for the onboard Ethernet adapter (RealTek 8152).
* At build time:
  * Support for non-x86-64 (incl. native RISC-V) host.
  * Support for parallel builds (vendor requires `make -j1`).
  * Support for upstream GCC cross-compilation toolchain.
  * Compatibility with up-to-date host glibc.
  * No external downloads (except for git submodules).
  * No RTOS.
  * No Buildroot/Busybox root file system (pick your own!).
  * No executable binaries without sources.

# Installation

**WARNINGS**:
* Make sure that you have backed up any data from the microSD card.
  Existing data will be overwritten and permanently lost.
* Ascertain the correct device node for the microSD card whilst flashing.
  If you use another device node, you may erase the data on your hard-drive
  or whatever else.

The following instructions assume that you have a Linux (or BSD) desktop
computer. Your mileage may vary if you use another operating system.

* Download and decompress the system image, or [rebuild it](#Build).
* Flash the system image `sysimage-sdcard.img` onto a free microSD card.
  For instance, if the SD card device node is `/dev/sdz`:
```
# dd if=sysimage-sdcard.img of=/dev/sdz bs=1M conv=sync
```
* Edit the partition table of microSD card with an ad-hoc tool,
  such as GNU Parted to:
  * extend the partition table to the entire SD card and
  * resize the "`rootfs`" (number 5) root partition.
* Resize the file system of the root partition.
* Install a Linux RISC-V distribution on the root partition:
  * [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.remlab.net/op/k230-canmv-debian.shtml).
* Put the microSD card into the TF slot of the K230-CanMV board and power on.

# Troubleshooting

The board has a built-in serial port available through the USB CDC ACM protocol
on the power USB-C port.

To troubleshoot, connect the board with the provided USB cable to a free port
on a Linux desktop, and attach to the serial port, e.g.:
```
$ cu -l ttyACM0
```

## U-boot enviroment CRC errors

By default, the partition (number 3) to store the U-boot environment is empty,
and therefore invalid as far as U-boot is concerned. This is deliberate: we
want U-boot to use its default settings.

The error is essentially harmless. But if you want to avoid it anyway,
just save the current environment from the U-boot command line prompt.

## Ethernet interface reports no link (no carrier)

There is a known issue with the RealTek 8152 USB Ethernet adapter,
whereby it does not detect the link. To work around this, disable Ethernet
auto-negotiation and force a link speed of 10 MBits/s, e.g.:
```
# ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 10 duplex full
```
Note that [the vendor kernel is even worse off](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk/issues/35).

# Build

To rebuild the system image yourself:

* Install the `riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc`, GNU/make, `xxd`, `gawk`, `sfdisk`,
  `fakeroot` and Python 3, e.g.:
```
# apt-get install install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu make xxd gawk fdisk \
                             fakeroot python3
```
* Clone this repository and rebuild:
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules \
	https://code.videolan.org/Courmisch/k230-boot.git
$ cd k230-boot
$ make
```
